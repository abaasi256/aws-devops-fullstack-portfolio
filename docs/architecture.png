# Converting SVG to PNG

The architecture diagram has been created as an SVG file (`architecture.svg`) in the docs directory. To convert it to PNG format:

1. Open the SVG file in a web browser
2. Use the browser's print function (Ctrl+P or Cmd+P)
3. Select "Save as PDF" or similar option
4. Use an online converter or local tool to convert the PDF to PNG
5. Save the resulting file as `architecture.png` in this directory

Alternatively, you can use tools like:

- Inkscape (free, open-source): Open the SVG file and export as PNG
- Adobe Illustrator: Open the SVG file and export as PNG
- Online converters: Upload the SVG file to services like CloudConvert, SVG2PNG, etc.

Once converted, replace this file with the actual PNG image.
